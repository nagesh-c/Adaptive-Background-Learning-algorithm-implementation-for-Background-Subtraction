The Adapative Background Learning is a background subtraction algorithm which models the each frame, based on this model the background subtraction of the frames happen.

To execute :
	`g++ -o output main.cpp AAdaptiveBackgroundLearning.cpp`

Output will be:
	`Input Window`
	`Background Subtracted Window`
	`Modeling Window`.
